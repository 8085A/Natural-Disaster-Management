# Natural-Disaster-Management
This is the project idea for Microsoft's CodeFunDo Challenge.

----

A natural disaster can have major terrible consequences such as loss of lives and damage to property and infrastructure, however, we can, with the help of technology help in managing it quickly and efficiently to minimize the consquences. In a country like India, where almost everyone has a mobile phone, I plan to create a serverless communications platform that can connect families and neighbour in the locality or village and with the relief aid workers/volunteers. 
In times of the disaster, messages or even voice/pictures/videos can be sent to people in the same location instantly and without having to "Add contact". It will be equiped with auto-translation tools to get rid of the language barrier. I will use Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services API for this. To relieve panic important messages will be broadcasted, such as evacuation plans/routes or where to meet. We can also use DTN (delay tolerant network) based communication.
